                Step into a relentless world in this fast-paced top-down shooter, inspired by titles like Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment. You
                play as a lone survivor hunted down by overwhelming hordes of enemies ‚Äî up to 200 on screen ‚Äî in a high-stakes race against time where
                every second matters. <br /><br />
                As you level up, choose from a randomized set of bonuses to craft a unique build with every run. No two games are the same, and every
                decision could mean the difference between survival and defeat. With ever-increasing difficulty, your single objective is clear: stay
                alive as long as possible and rack up the highest score. Will you climb your way to the top of the leaderboard? üèÜ
