### Light Souls

Step into a relentless world in this fast-paced top-down shooter, inspired by titles like Vampire Survivors and Halls of Torment. You
play as a lone survivor hunted down by overwhelming hordes of enemies — up to 200 on screen — in a high-stakes race against time where
every second matters.

As you level up, choose from a randomized set of bonuses to craft a unique build with every run. No two games are the same, and every
decision could mean the difference between survival and defeat. With ever-increasing difficulty, your single objective is clear: stay
alive as long as possible and rack up the highest score. Will you climb your way to the top of the leaderboard? 🏆
